This is a demo of "declarative, form-based login".<br>
The access control is managed by the Java EE container.<br>
When trying to access a protected resource, the Java EE container will prompt for a login,<br>
and then communicates with the "login module", whose task is to check credentials
towards a backend, and populate the user's "roles".<br>
The Java EE container allows access to web resources according to declarations in web.xml.
<br>
In this model, it is not possible to access the login page manually.
